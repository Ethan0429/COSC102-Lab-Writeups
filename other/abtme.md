# About Me

Hey I'm Ethan Rickert, and I'm currently an undergraduate TA for UTK's Spring 2022 COSC 102 course.

I love video games, programming, teaching others anything programming related, and occasionally innocuously gaslighting my friends.

If you like what I've done here, star the repo! It makes me look cool and costs nothing whatsoever. Also my ego is fragile so I need a lot of those suckers to build up my self-esteem.

I'm just ranting at this point.

You can find me at the following things
