## Overview
In case it wasn't obvious from the name of the lab, the objective of this lab is to emulate a simple, text-based, slightly less complex blackjack game.

### Rules
1. There will be **exactly 2 players** in the game - the actual player and the "dealer".
2. The deck will consist of 52 cards belonging to both the player and the dealer. (i.e. no duplicates)
3. Each card in the deck will have both a `value` and a `suit` combination of some kind   
    
        Values: Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King
        Suits: Hearts, Diamonds, Spades, Clubs
so a card could be Ace of Spades, 3 of Clubs, Queen of Hearts -- you get the idea.
4. Each card will have an abbreviation consisting of 2 capital chars
